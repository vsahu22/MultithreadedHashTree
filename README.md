# MultithreadedHashTree
Program that uses multithreading to speed up the computation of a hash value for a given file. The hash function being used is jenkins one_at_a_time hash. A report is included that analyzes how the number of threads affects the time it takes to compute the hash value, and the speedup. The testcases used for this report are included under the "testcases" folder.
